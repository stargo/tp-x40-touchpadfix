When retrofitting a new touchpad (with real buttons) into a machine
of the clickpad-generation, the new touchpad is not fully supported
as the PNP-ID of the old touchpad is hardcoded in the BIOS ACPI
DSDT. Most drivers (Windows/Linux) will not change their behaviour
on the synaptics board id alone.

This tries to fix it by patching the system DSDT with the PNP ID
of the touchpad from a T450s, which allows the respective driver
to work on Windows and the synaptics-driver on Linux to correctly
identify and handle the hardware buttons.

The modified ACPI DSDT (an original FACP) is injected into the
system by grub before loading any OS.

This has only been tested on a Thinpad T440s retorfitted with a
new touchpad, not on other models where this mod is also possible.
Chances are high, that the patche against the dsdt does not
apply and needs to be changed slightly.

How to use:

Running `make' will read the systems' DSDT table, decompile, patch
and recompile it in the current directory.
After that `make install' will put the modified dsdt.aml and original
facp.dat into /boot/acpi/ and add a helper-script to /etc/grub.d/
before calling update-grub.
This will most likely only work on Debian based distributions.
